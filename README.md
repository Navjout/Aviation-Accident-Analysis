STEPS INVOLVED
-------------------------------
### Task 1 : Import the standard libraries

### Task 2 : Import datatset
All records we got and shown as top 10 and last 5 records

### Task3 : Check for missing values
Missing values as per columns

Replaced time data

All the data of time is categorized.

Converted Data

### Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
4.1 : Total Accidents by year

Grouped the data of accidents yearly

Plotted a Graph of count of accident by year and Graph of count of accidents by month, weekday and hour

4.2 : Passenger vs military flights

Accident of No. of passengers and military

Time Added

Year wise no of military and passengers died

Plotted a Graph of total number of accidents by flight type and count of accidents by flight type yearly.

4.3 : Total Number of fatalities

Plotted a Graph of total no of fatalities by year and ratio by year

### Task 5 : Dataset Aviation2 import
Imported the dataset and got the records yearly and also in between 1970 to 2008.

Plotted a graph of total number of passenger by year, total no of deaths by year and fatalities/total no of passengers ratio by year

### Task 6 : Plot ratio and number of deaths in one plot

Plotted a graph

### Task 7 : Operator Analysis

We got Count of operators

Graph of total count of operator

Graph of total fatalities of the operator

Graph of count of accidents by year

# Conclusion:
In this project we explored, analysed and visualized aviation accidents and related factors such as reasons, survival rates, fatalities, locations etc. Detailed analyses of following factors: 

-The planes crashed per year. 

-People aboard per year during crashes. 

-People dead per year during crashes. 

-People survived per year during crashes.
